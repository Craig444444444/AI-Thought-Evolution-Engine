## üöÄ Introduction

The AI Thought Evolution Engine is a Python-based project designed to simulate the evolution of thought and debate among artificial agents with different philosophical perspectives. This engine aims to explore how ideas emerge, evolve, and interact within a simulated environment. It's intended for research, educational, and non-commercial purposes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Diverse Agents:** Agents with various roles (e.g., Rationalist, Chaotic, Humanist) engage in debates, generating and exchanging arguments.
*   **Semantic Similarity:** Utilizes the `sentence-transformers` library to calculate semantic similarity between arguments.
*   **Knowledge Graph Visualization:** Visualizes the evolving network of ideas using `networkx` and `matplotlib`.
*   **Debate History Logging:** Records debate history for analysis and further exploration.
*   **Consciousness-Centric Mode:** (Optional) An advanced mode that focuses on the evolution of thought around consciousness.
